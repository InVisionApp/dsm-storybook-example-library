This repository includes example library implementations in React, Vue and Angular that are pre-configured for the [@dsm-storybook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@invisionapp/dsm-storybook) plugin. 

## Setup

In the selected sample directory run

```
npm install
```

## Preview

To run the sample Storybook with dsm-storybook integration locally, run:

npm run dsm-storybook:preview
```

## Publish to DSM

Follow the steps documented in the [Getting started with live components](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028509991) article to embed the example components in DSM.
